The main page for CS109 locates in http://cs109.github.io/2015/index.html.

This grabber is using Python, basically to extract the download link for the mp4 for each lesson. No offense.

By using Chrome's web development kit (Press button F12), file transfered from server is observed as a "GET" method. So using requests library to ask for sources and using innate json library to parse the package returned
results are stored in an wrapped xml piece. Then xml.dom is used to parse the xml strings.
